<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span> customary Hello World page</p>

<p>In this post, I will explain my motivation behind writing this blog. </p>
This blog in general will contain the encapsulation of my efforts over the past 5 years(i.e. since 2012). As a wannabe computer scientist, it is very imperative for me to create and update my personal web space. 
Although there were various options available for dynamic applications, I choose Jekyll for writing my blog. This is done for three reasons:
<ul>
<li>Jekyll generates static content which is by default secure.</li>
<li>Since I was going to use version control anyway, and I don't mind being all-out-techy about random mumbling(s) on the internet.</li>
<li>Github pages along with Jekyll provide a clean way of deployment with free hosting.. so yeah! </li>
</ul>

I shall blog mostly about either software or security, discussing important issues/hacks that I might have encountered while "traversing" through them. That said, a lot of you might find content on this blog self-referential. Now, I really avoid doing that but please bear with me if you encounter something of similar sort. 

I have recently started competitive programming. So you might find me blogging about some really cool algo/problems I think is worth sharing.
