<p>In this post, I will explain my motivation behind writing this blog. </p>
This blog in general will contain the encapsulation of my efforts over the past 5 years. It will also offer some tips and sample algos on competitive programming and in general programming concepts as well as my ambitions as a wanna be computer scientist.

I feel now that documenting those would have made things such as writing a resume` or a personal statements a lot easier. This reminds me, one of the most common questions asked in interviews today is : "What was the most difficult bug/problem you have ever solved?"
