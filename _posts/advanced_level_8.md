Advanced Level 8

1. Egregious:
The term means something that is related to shockingly (outstandingly) bad stuff. The following article mentions the term:

2. Sententious: morally high handed (pretentious)

3. Inveterate: habitual (chronic)
Of course, Brandel, who got degree at the University of Texas in speech communication and is an inveterate reader, was right.

4. turpitude(a corrupt or depraved or degenerate act or practice)
Turpitude comes from the Latin word turpitudo, which means "repulsiveness." Corrupt politicians get booted out of office for acts of turpitude, like taking bribes in exchange for lucrative government contracts. Turpitude often follows the word moral, and acts of moral turpitude are usually crimes that are unusually sick or corrupt.
During his reign, Caligula indulged in unspeakable sexual practices, so it's not surprising that he will forever be remembered for his 

5. Subsume(contain or include) - Subsume means to absorb or include. A successful company might subsume a failing competitor through a merger, or love may subsume you in the early stages of a romance.
He probably didn’t kill several other victims subsumed under the Atlanta Child Murders label.

6. bucolic(relating to shepherds or herdsmen or devoted to raising sheep or cattle) - pastoral
As an adjective, bucolic refers to an ideal country life that many yearn for. If your parents wanted to raise you in a bucolic environment, you may find yourself living 45 minutes away from the nearest movie theater or person your age. Not ideal.
Chambers rides a bicycle around the bucolic postwar English countryside, getting mixed up in intrigue while battling his own demons, including combat PTSD.

7. Restive(tense - impatient especially under restriction or delay)
To be restive is to be impatient or on edge — it's an edgy state. When you feel like your skin is too tight and your nerves are ready to snap, when you feel ready to explode, you are restive.
The wider state of Jammu and Kashmir, which includes the restive Kashmir Valley, is India’s only Muslim-majority state.

8. equivocal(Equivocal means uncertain or ambiguous. If you ask your teacher what's on an upcoming test and she gives you an equivocal answer, you won't be able to narrow down your studying.)
Democrats were too equivocal in how they framed their ideology, in Tulchin’s view.

9. enervate(sap energy from - weaken mentally or morally - To enervate is to weaken, wear down, or even bum out. A three-hour lecture on the history of socks might thrill someone, it would enervate most people. So would a too-long soak in a hot tub. With your parents.)
But they share a quality of constant distraction, a permanent, enervating uncertainty about what they will get up to next.
We prefer wines that are nimble and energetic, that refresh the palate rather than enervate.

10. denigrate(attack a reputation - To denigrate is to say bad things — true or false — about a person or thing. Your reputation as a math whiz might be hurt if your jealous classmate manages to denigrate you, even though the accusations are unfounded.)
He also strongly denigrated the News Letter journalist's character, claiming he was "despicable... immature... and simplistic".

11. acrimony(Acrimony is bitterness, or ill will. Acrimony is a spiteful word. It sounds bitter, like acid.)
His combative performance brought the House Judiciary Committee, never a harmonious assembly, to a new level of acrimony.

12. recondite(difficult to penetrate; incomprehensible to one of ordinary understanding or knowledge)
It's rather difficult to penetrate the meaning of recondite. Fitting, because it's an adjective that basically means hard for the average mind to understand.

The learned and recondite disputes currently embroiling many conservatives, disputes about various doctrines of interpretive constitutional “originalism,” are often illuminating and sometimes conclusive in constitutional controversies.

Could also mean arcane.. (requiring secret or mysterious knowledge)

13. Gainsay(take exception of - challenge, dispute) - a verb, means "contradict" or "speak out against." When you challenge authority, you gainsay, as in teachers don't like it when unruly students gainsay them.
Her role in passing the Affordable Care Act was absolutely heroic and should not be gainsaid.

14. Reprobate(Unprincipled person) - There's no way around it, a reprobate is a bad egg. The black sheep of the family, missing a moral compass — a reprobate's been called everything from a deviant to an evildoer to a scoundrel.)
deviating from what is considered moral or right or proper or good
In delivering this threat, Macron recognized that the responsibility to protect the environment is a matter of global concern and not a prerogative of a reprobate sovereign.

15. Impudent(An impudent person is bold, sassy, and shameless. If your teacher asks the class to open their textbooks, and you snap back, "Let's not and say we did," you're being impudent.)
"Boris Johnson followed through on the riskiest and most impudent bet thus far in the crazy history of Brexit, even at the cost of triggering a constitutional crisis," says Il Foglio in Italy.

16. inexorable(not to be placated or appeased or moved by entreaty/impervious to pleas, persuasion, requests, reason)
My visit to the wall coincided with the slow yet seemingly inexorable grinding of the gears of Brexit, which amounts to nothing so much as the construction of a great wall.
Impossible to stop (The rise of the computer was an inexorable shift in technology and culture.)

17. Apocryphal (Urban legends — stories about phantom hitchhikers, deep-fried rats, and spider eggs in bubblegum — are classic examples of apocryphal tales. They're told as if they're true, but no one can ever verify their origins or authenticity. - Today, any dubious or unverifiable story may be dismissed as apocryphal. Originally, however, apocryphal was reserved for religious writings that were not included in the Torah or the New Testament of the Bible because the divinity of the texts was not certain. These texts are known as the Apocrypha and are included in the Septuagint (a Greek version of the Hebrew Bible) and the Vulgate (a Latin Bible edited in the 4th century).)
being of questionable authenticity
He frequently shared the apocryphal story of Gen. Jack Pershing mass murdering Muslims with bullets dipped in pig's blood, applauding his willingness to win by any means necessary.

18. belie - To belie means to contradict. If you are 93 but look like you are 53, then your young looks belie your age.
We get belie from the Old English beleogan, which meant "to deceive by lying." It suggests characteristics or behavior that inadvertently or deliberately hide the truth. To remember it, just think "be lying." Snow White's decision to barge into the Seven Dwarfs' home without invitation belied her gentle nature

19. Exiguity - the quality of being meager (leanness, meagerness, meagreness, poorness, scantiness, scantness)/spareness, sparseness, sparsity, thinness
the property of being scanty or scattered; lacking denseness
Type of: deficiency, inadequacy, insufficiency / lack of an adequate quantity or number
The strong sonorous voice of the layman was in singular contrast with the exiguity of his thin, stunted frame. 
His jaw fell; there was a remarkable exiguity about the coat which was inexplicable.

20. staid(staid - Something that is staid is dignified, respectable — possibly even boring, like a staid dinner party that is heavy on the important guests but light on the laughs)
Staid is pronounced just like "stayed" — in fact, it comes from stay, meaning "fixed" or "permanent." Something that is staid is sedate, slightly dull, and tends to stay the same. Whether it’s a middle-class lifestyle, a conservative law firm, your unadventurous aunt, or an old navy plaid sofa, the word staid can be used to describe anything that maintains a respectable self-restraint and takes no chances.
The event is tamer than it used to be, with more Silicon Valley types and fewer anarchists, but it’s still wild territory for a staid academic.

21. Palaver(Palaver is a type of empty nonsense or useless talk. During an election year, you might tire of hearing the palaver of politicians.)
Whether you call it malarkey, hokum, mumbo-jumbo, or truthiness, there are a lot of words for talk that cannot be trusted or believed. Palaver is part of this club. Specifically, palaver tends to be hot air — empty words from a blowhard. Palaver can also be sweet talk — a type of flattery. You can use this word as a verb too: by palavering, you might try to impress someone or get someone to do you a favor.

Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, boasts that he’s winning the long game: that voters despising the SW1 palaver will punish the parties that stopped Brexit.

22. galvanize(The verb galvanize refers to stimulating muscles with an electrical current, and this word is also used to suggest stimulating someone into action. We advise not using electricity in galvanizing children to do their homework. The word galvanize was coined to honor the 18th Century scientist Luigi Galvani, who found that a spark could make a frog's legs move. This discovery led to further studies in bioelectrogenesis, or what Galvani called "animal electricity," and became the basis for Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (a novel in which a mad scientist attempts to use electricity to galvanize a monster to life). Nowadays, people use this term much more figuratively, like when they describe galvanizing a political movement or even a sports team into action.)
The group is also working on galvanizing voter turnout, something sure to work against the prospect of Trump’s re-election were it to prove successful.

23. disaffected(discontent) The adjective disaffected describes someone who is dissatisfied or rebellious. Usually if you're disaffected, you're upset with people in authority. You and your fellow disaffected workers might become so upset about the lack of raises that you decided to boycott work.)
You might have heard the term "disaffected youth," which refers to young people rebelling against some aspect of society. For example, disaffected youth might fight against their lack of political freedom. Disaffected can also be used to describe things rather than people, like the disaffected lyrics in a song or the disaffected mood of a poem describing an unhappy or bitter state of mind. The word disaffected comes from disaffect, meaning "estranged, hostile."

`intricate {Intricate things are complex and have many elements: they're not simple. Think of the intricate wiring of a computer's motherboard, or the intricate plot of a movie that you have a hard time following}`

24. gossamer (delicate)
Gossamer is something super fine and delicate — like a spider web or the material of a wedding veil.
The original gossamer, from which these meanings come from, is the fine, filmy substance spiders excrete to weave their webs. A dress can be gossamer-like, if its fabric is so sheer as to be see-through, or almost. Your chances of going to a good college are "gossamer thin" if you've never cracked a book in high school.

They streak past me into the hall in a blast of gossamer, and she slams the book she was swinging at them into the door casing.

25. ingratiate - To ingratiate is to make obvious efforts to gain someone's favor, in other words — to kiss up to someone.
Ingratiate has not strayed much from its Latin roots, in gratiam, (in plus gratia meaning "favor") which means "in favor" or "for the favor of." To ingratiate is to gain the favor of someone by doing lots of favors to the point of being a nudge. Like the teacher's pet who answers every question, stays after class to clean the chalkboard, and brings the teacher an apple every day. When you ingratiate yourself to people, you risk annoying them — like a little dog nipping at their heels.

They ingratiate themselves to office staff with food — “lunch and learn” is a common vehicle.

26. ignominious
Losing a football game stinks, but losing a game where, at the end, you are lying face down in a puddle of mud and the fans are burning effigies of you in the streets? That is an ignominious defeat.
Although ignominious can modify other words, it is nearly always attached to "defeat." It derives from the word ignominy, which means public shame or defeat. Ignominy derives from the Latin in- "not" + a variant of nomen "name."

The G-7 Research Group at the University of Toronto says that countries complied with 76% of their commitments from last year’s summit in Canada, despite its somewhat ignominious end in a Trump Twitter storm.

27. amenable
If your friends want to try sky diving and you're amenable to the idea, sounds like you're going to be jumping out of a plane. If a person or thing is amenable to something, they are ready, willing, or responsive.

Note that amenable is often followed by the preposition to, which makes amenable mean "able to be controlled or affected by something," as in "They are usually amenable to our wishes;" or "Her heart condition is not amenable to treatment." An amenable personality is open to influence or control and is willing to agree or yield.

“In some cases, pregnancy may not be observable or disclosed, and may not in and of itself disqualify an individual from being amenable for the program,” CBP said in a statement.

28. precipitous (extremely steep/done with very great haste and without due deliberation)
A sharp, steep drop — whether it's in a stock price, a roller coaster, or a star's popularity — could be described as a precipitous one. Put simply, precipitous means perilously steep.
Look closely and you'll spot most of the word precipice (a sheer, almost vertical cliff) in precipitous. Now imagine how you'd feel standing at the edge peering over, and you'll grasp the sense of impending danger that precipitous tends to imply. Precipitous declines in sales lead to bankruptcy. Precipitous mountainside hiking trails are not for the acrophobic. It can describe an ascent, but precipitous is most often used for things going literally or figuratively downhill.
She said colleagues’ “precipitous” ruling “sidesteps the ordinary judicial process to allow the Government to implement a rule that bypassed the ordinary rulemaking process.”
moving rapidly or performed quickly or in great haste(hasty, overhasty, precipitant, precipitate, hurried)

29. execrate
Just when you thought you knew every word in the book for hate, here's a new one: execrate. The word means to despise or also to curse.
Broken down to its Latin root, the word execrate means the opposite of being sacred or devoted to. When you execrate something, you are cursing it instead of making it holy. The word is not used all that often. If you say to someone, "I execrate you!" they might think you're casting an evil spell on them. Which in a way, by cursing them, you are.

Though the Democrats’ advantage over the GOP in voter identification is not particularly large — eight points, according to Gallup — 24 percent of Americans now accept the no-longer execrated label “liberal,” up seven points since 1992.

30. screed (a long monotonous harangue/a long piece of writing)
A screed is a long, boring speech or piece of writing with a bad attitude, like a rant. If you’ve had enough and you’re not going to take it anymore, go ahead and write an angry screed.
You can also call a screed a "harangue" or a "tirade." Another totally separate meaning of the word is “a construction tool made of wood or plaster that acts as a guide for the thickness of new plaster.” Screed originally meant "strip of cloth," like the kind you might write a long list on in the old days. Still, if you’re speaking or writing a screed, it’s like you’re reading a long tedious list.

In 2019, when cruelty is the headliner, the country’s most successful stadium comic is killing it at every stop with unfettered screeds about immigrants, slapping political rivals with nicknames like Pocahontas.
<abusive rant>

31.  venality (corruption)
Venality is the quality of being open to bribery or overly motivated by money. A government worker's venality might lead him to exchange state secrets for cash.
Criminals are known for their venality, being willing to break the law for a financial reward. This kind of venality can vary from police officers accepting bribes to politicians making decisions and passing laws based on campaign contributions. The Late Latin root word is venalitatem, "capable of being bought," from venum, "for sale."

Through his numerous discrete capers Guy Grand emerges as a god of venality and entropy, serially interfering in the affairs of American mortals.

32. solecism (a socially awkward or tactless act)
Ever snore at the opera? Burp at the dinner table? Forget your mom's birthday? Probably all three, right? Well, don't worry. Instead of just screwing up, what you did was commit a solecism. Sounds kinda neat that way, huh?
The origin of solecism comes from the ancient Greek word meaning "speaking incorrectly," and solecism does have another meaning that's more specifically verbal. If you say something incorrectly, or make a grammatical error in writing, that's also a solecism. It can be just as mortifying as burping at the dinner table. Well, almost.

An egregious linguistic solecism vitiated the otherwise well-written and informative March 5 news article “Ben Carson to leave HUD at end of Trump’s term.”

33. laconic
Laconic is an adjective that describes a style of speaking or writing that uses only a few words, often to express complex thoughts and ideas. A more laconic way to write that last sentence might be this: laconic means brief.
There’s a friend of yours who doesn’t talk very much, and when he does, he says maybe three words and then becomes quiet again. You could describe that friend as laconic. The word comes from Laconia, a region in ancient Greece where the local Spartan rulers gave very short speeches. Being laconic can be bad when it sounds rude to be so brief, but it can be good if you’re in a rush to get somewhere.
> brief and to the point; effectively cut short (crisp, curt, terse)

Their camaraderie is effortless, in part because Pitt exudes a laconic confidence as Cliff.

34. reticent
Reticent means either quiet or restrained. If you're reticent about your feelings, you like to keep them to yourself, and you're probably quiet in rowdy groups where everyone is talking over each other.
The original meaning of reticent describes someone who doesn’t like to talk. Be careful in your context, however. Reticent can refer to someone who is restrained and formal, but it can also refer to someone who doesn’t want to draw attention to herself or who prefers seclusion to other people. Don’t confuse reticent with reluctant, which means unwilling.

reluctant to draw attention to yourself/cool and formal in manner/temperamentally disinclined to talk
Political campaigns generally seek to keep the focus on the candidate, so most were reticent to share names of staffers or outside advisers.

35. incisive
The adjective incisive describes something that is sharp, decisive, and direct. A comment that cuts right to the bone can be just as incisive as an actual knife.
The word incisive is rooted in a Latin word that literally means "to cut with a sharp edge." To help you remember the meaning, you can think of the similar word, incisors, which are the teeth that are sharp and cut and tear. The more figurative meaning of describing something that is mentally sharp first appeared in the 1850s. Keen criticism and cutting remarks have been called incisive ever since.

36. commensurate
The word commensurate has to do with things that are similar in size and therefore appropriate. Many people think the death penalty is a commensurate punishment for murder. In other words, the penalty fits the crime.

When things are commensurate, they're fair, appropriate, and the right size. If you got a ticket for jaywalking, you shouldn't get ten years in prison — that penalty is not commensurate with the crime. The word commensurate is usually followed by with or to; one thing is commensurate with or to another.

37. eschew
If you eschew something, you deliberately avoid it. If you live the bohemian life in the city, then most likely you eschew the suburbs.
Eschew comes from a word meaning dread, or shun. So to eschew something isn’t simply to avoid it, the way you would avoid walking in a puddle––it's stronger than that. You eschew things that you find morally or aesthetically wrong, or that you have chosen to find wrong. A dieter might eschew a chocolate sundae, not because he doesn’t like it, but because he’s afraid of what it will do to his waistline.

In almost every single profile of him the way he dresses crops up, as if it were impossible for a human being to eschew sartorial convention without that being a sign of edgy intellect.

38. ingenuous
Someone who is ingenuous shows a childlike innocence, trust, and openness. One of the things kindergarten teachers value is the chance to work with kids while they're still relatively ingenuous––their open, trusting natures are a joy.
A near synonym is naive. Its opposite is disingenuous, which means "giving a false impression of being honest and sincere." Don't confuse the word ingenuous with the similarly spelled ingenious, which means "very smart or clever." Ingenuous is from Latin ingenuus "having the qualities of people born free, noble, honest, open," ultimately formed from the prefix in- "in" plus gignere "to produce."

39. calumny (slander | malign)
Use the noun calumny to characterize verbal attacks that are meant to destroy reputations or friendships. You've probably seen political ads during election time that rely on calumny to move voters.
Calumny comes from the Latin word calvi, meaning "to trick, deceive," which is why it can also describe falsely accusing someone or quoting them out of context with the intent to do them harm. Some political candidates use this tactic against opponents in the hope that voters will be tricked into thinking that the accusations are true

A complicit media was all too willing to convict Trump in the court of public opinion by perpetuating these calumnies without bothering to honestly examine either the relevant facts or applicable law.

40. parsimonious 
A parsimonious person is unwilling to spend a lot of money. You know those people who count up every penny when it's time to split a restaurant bill? You can call them parsimonious. Or cheap.
Stingy is the most common and general synonym of parsimonious, but there are many other near synonyms, including thrifty, frugal, penurious, niggardly, penny-pinching, miserly, tight-fisted, tight. The adjective parsimonious was formed in English from the noun parsimony, "the quality of being careful in spending." It is a combination of the Latin verb parcere, "to spare," plus an Old French suffix –ous, "having the quality of."

41. vociferous
Vociferous describes loudmouths, such as the vociferous mob at the soccer game.
Vociferous is from the Latin vociferari, meaning "to shout, yell." If you break it down to the first part, take vox, meaning "voice" and add it to ferre, meaning "to carry," then vociferous describes voices that carry; you can hear a vociferous person from across the room at a dance party. Vociferous isn't just loud, but annoying, too, like when the vociferous fans of the opposing team chant insults in unison. Try yanking a cookie out of a little kid's hand if you want to hear a vociferous reaction.
conspicuously and offensively loud; given to vehement outcry.

Ms Patel was a vociferous opponent of the backstop when Theresa May was prime minister - voting against her deal three times - and took the same line as the DUP.

42. impertinent
If someone's rude without being openly nasty, like a kid in the back row of class quietly heckling his teacher, you can call him impertinent.
Impertinent originally meant just what it sounds like, "not pertinent, irrelevant," but it also came to mean "inappropriate, out of place" and therefore "intrusive, presumptuous; behaving without proper respect; insolent." It still carries a condescending air, so it's best used of or to a child being snippy to a grownup: "Don't be impertinent!" The stress is on the second syllable: im-PERT-inent.

The details were later officially struck from the court records when a judge ruled they were unnecessary to the case, saying they were "immaterial and impertinent" to the "central claim".

43. iconoclast
Are you always challenging the establishment? Or provoking popular thought by attacking traditions and institutions? Then you're definitely an iconoclast.
To be called an iconoclast today is usually kind of cool — they're rugged individualists, bold thinkers who don't give a hoot what tradition calls for. But back in medieval Greece, the iconoclasts had a more thuggish reputation. Stemming from the Greek words eikon, meaning "image," and klastes, meaning "breaker," an iconoclast was someone who destroyed religious sculptures and paintings.

As an abbess, she continued to defy Emperor Theophilos, an iconoclast who was smashing up works of art and religious images.

44. petulant
Choose the adjective petulant to describe a person or behavior that is irritable in a childish way.
The adjective, petulant, is a disapproving term used to describe a bad-tempered child, an adult behaving like an angry child or behavior of this type. Angry or annoyed mean the same thing, but if you choose the word, petulant, you are indicating that it is unreasonable or unjustified. Petulant came to English in the late 16th century from the Latin petulantem "forward, insolent" but was not recorded to mean childishly irritable until the late 1700s.
(easily irritated or annoyed)
I try to hide my disappointment; it was kind of Judith to bring this for me, and I don’t want to seem more petulant than I already did earlier in the meeting.

45. pedantic
There's nothing wrong with focusing on the details, but someone who is pedantic makes a big display of knowing obscure facts and details.
Pedantic means "like a pedant," someone who's too concerned with literal accuracy or formality. It's a negative term that implies someone is showing off book learning or trivia, especially in a tiresome way. You don't want to go antique-shopping with a pedantic friend, who will use the opportunity to bore you with his in-depth knowledge of 18th-century porcelain kitty-litter boxes.

Warren’s stump speech is disciplined and on message; her superpower is the ability to explain issues in simple terms; some critics find her style pedantic.

46. gall (rudeness)
Gall describes something irritating, like someone very rude. If you barge into a bakery and cut in front of a sweet old lady, then you have gall.
If someone has gall, they're irritating. In fact, as a verb, gall means "to irritate" like new tight jeans that gall your thighs. Gall is "bile," too, like what's in a gall bladder. Back in the days of Hippocrates, if the four humors of the body were out of whack, it affected your spirits. If you had too much bile, or gall, then you'd be aggressive or depressed. It's also a noun for "deep feeling of ill will."

The really galling thing was that the wireless company I used for my family’s personal cellphones was also The Washington Post’s corporate wireless provider.

47. prevaricate (be deliberately ambiguous or unclear in order to mislead or withhold information)
When you prevaricate, you lie or mislead. Now, go ahead and tell me whether you already knew that meaning, and don’t prevaricate about it — give me the story straight!
While prevaricate basically means to lie, it also has the sense of making it hard to know exactly what the lie was. You talk in a confusing way, go back and forth, and as deliberately as possible mislead someone. Government officials, bureaucrats, and sneaky types prevaricate in the hopes that it will be too difficult to figure out whether they've been doing something wrong. Don't prevaricate with your parents — it will definitely make you look guilty, but they just won't be sure of what!

If the prime minister continued to prevaricate and attempt changes to the backstop, Cooper said, she and others would attempt to force a new process.

48. rankle
Rankle is a cranky-sounding verb that means to eat away at or aggravate to the point of causing anger. If you want to rankle a cat, try splashing it with water and then putting it in the bathtub.
Rankle goes back to the French verb rancler, which comes from an old word for "festering sore," which paints a pretty negative picture of what it means to rankle. A sore that festers gets worse and worse, or more infected, and if you rankle someone, they will get more and more angry. "Ankle" rhymes with rankle, and if you were to prank a friend and hold him by his ankles over a trash can every day for a week, it would definitely rankle him.

Her no-holds-barred Twitter feed particularly rankles her opponents, and some critics suggest her labeling of Mr. Khan as a stooge of the military was one reason for her arrest.

49. torpor (a state of motor and mental inactivity with a partial suspension of sensibility)
Torpor is a state of mental and physical inactivity. "After a huge Thanksgiving meal, my family members fall into a torpor; no one can even pick up the TV remote."
Torpor can be used in everyday speech, but it's also a scientific term for a state of deep sleep that allows animals to conserve energy. Certain species of bats, birds, and frogs rely on torpor for survival during tough times. While humans don't technically belong to this group of animals, they certainly appear to, especially after a large meal and on most Monday mornings.

More recently, the psychoanalyst Josh Cohen identifies how a certain torpor or aimlessness he noticed in some of his clients seems to be a typical response to our culture of over-achievement and overwork.

50. predilection (a predisposition in favor of something/a strong liking)
A predilection is a preference for or bias toward something. If you have a predilection for wool clothing, you should take up knitting.
Predilection is based on the Latin verb praediligere, or "prefer before others," which breaks down to prae, before, and diligere, "choose or love." We often use the word predilection for tendencies that people seem to have been born with, also called predispositions. If you're a night owl, you probably have a predilection for cities, while morning people tend to prefer the country.

They employed it to marvel at the baffling behaviors of white folks, like a predilection for pumpkin spice anything.

51. parochial (relating to or supported by or located in a parish / narrowly restricted in outlook or scope)
If an issue or a matter is parochial, it is trivial or only concerns a local area. Likewise, a person with a parochial mentality is narrow-minded, or not open to new ideas.
Parochial comes to English from Greek through Latin with the meaning "of a parish." As a parochial school is a school that is affiliated with a particular church, the connection is easy to see. In general though, parochial refers to a narrow or limited point of view — that is, an outlook that extends no further than the limits of the parish. You may feel that there is no room in your life for the parochial attitudes of the older generation. Let's hope you remain open-minded as you age!

Then, as now, she was a self-described progressive, introducing herself as a potentially history-making pick in a multicultural city of vanguard liberalism, parochial neighborhood factions and often staggering income inequality.

52. mulct (money extracted as a penalty / swindle)
The meaning of mulct is as nasty as it sounds; it means to fine someone or the money you collect as a result of a fine. No one wants to pay an extra mulct to the city, when it's the city who mismanaged the budget.
Got mulct? Then somebody took your money. They "milked" you by mulcting you. And the money that they took? That's called mulct, too. Some people believe that there's no difference between being mulcted by the state and being shaken down by the mob. In fact, the word mulct is often used to mean having your money taken unfairly or as a kind of punishment or as extortion.

A pecuniary mulct or penalty laid upon a delinquent for offending against a ban; as, a mulct paid to a bishop by one guilty of sacrilege or other crimes.

53. refractory
Imagine yourself pulling a dog who doesn't want to walk. The dog is refractory, or stubbornly resisting your authority.
The word refractory comes from a Latin word meaning "obstinate" and can also be used to mean "not responsive to something." If you have a cold you can't shake, you could say you have a refractory cough. The word can also be used to describe a material that maintains its strength at very high heats. The outside of a space shuttle is made of refractory material, so that it can reenter the atmosphere without burning up.

It is approved to treat patients with advanced, refractory heart failure as a bridge to cardiac transplantation and as destination therapy in patients for whom subsequent transplantation is not planned.

54. perfidy
If you shared your most embarrassing secrets with a friend who then told them to everyone he knows, his betrayal could be described as perfidy.
The noun perfidy means "deceitfulness" or "treachery," so it's not just being mean, but deliberately betraying a trust. The Latin root of perfidy is made up of per, or "through," and fidem, or "faith." So in order for perfidy to happen, there has to have first been a sense of faith in place, which was then broken or betrayed.

As we demonstrated in Korea, the work of containing Soviet-backed Communism does not necessarily require the kinds of perfidies our government engaged in during the Vietnam War.

55. deferential
When a young person shows respect and obedience to an older person, they’re being deferential to the elder’s wisdom and experience.
To be obedient, courteous, or dutiful are all ways of being deferential. Bowing low to the Queen is a deferential act when visiting Buckingham Palace. On sports teams, rookies are usually deferential to the veterans and star players, while all players should be deferential to the coach. All employees are expected to be at least a little deferential to their bosses. Being deferential shows respect, but also means "I know my place, and it's lower than yours."

He said Mr. Pompeo “is much more deferential to the president, and more interested in cultivating a good relationship with the president than sticking to his ideological guns.”

56. Germane (relevant and appropriate)
Germane means relevant; it fits in. If you are giving a speech on dog training, stick to the germane, canine stuff. Topics that would not be germane? Catnip toys, hamster wheels, and the use of a saddle.
You can thank Shakespeare for the modern meaning of the adjective germane. The word originally referred to people who have the same parents. Shakespeare added the word's figurative meaning of objects being closely related or relevant when he used it in the play Hamlet. You might want to bring up all sorts of complaints during an argument with your best friend, but she says the two of you should only discuss issues that are germane to the current fight.

However, once people began reporting their own stories of educational fortitude, the material value of whiteness was suddenly less germane to the conversation.

57. querulous
Querulous means “having a tendency to complain” or, more directly put, “whiny.” Sure, no one can be happy all the time, but that’s no excuse for being querulous.
Querulous may remind you of the word query, which means “question.” However, the two words are not closely related. It’s perfectly reasonable to make a query; just don’t be querulous if you don’t like the answer you get. Querulous does share its origins with the word quarrel, which means “argument” — and that’s what’s likely to happen if you complain too much.

If that were true — or exclusively true — there’s no way we’d be hanging on every word of these querulous, increasingly scattershot theorizers, kibitzers and confessors.

58. platitude
If an executive gives a speech that begins, "This business is all about survival of the fittest. You need to burn the midnight oil and take one for the team," his employees might get sick of listening to these meaningless clichés and tell him to cut the platitudes.
The English language contains many old, worn-out clichés, or platitudes. Phrases like "ants in your pants" and "as American as apple pie" are so overused that they've almost lost their meaning. People rely on these tired old remarks when they can't think of anything original to say. Be warned: if you throw too many platitudes into your conversations, people are eventually going to get tired of listening to you.

When they advocate the vacuous platitude about co-locating jobs and housing, it’s just a euphemism for crowding more people into every square meter of living space in our region.

59. censure (harsh criticism or disapproval/the state of being excommunicated/rebuke formally)
Censure is a noun referring to very strong criticism; the verb means to criticize very strongly. If you take your dad's car without telling him, you can expect him to censure you severely, and maybe even ground you as well.
The noun and verb are most closely associated with official expressions of disapproval, as when Congress censures a senator. The noun is from Latin cēnsūra "censorship," from cēnsor "an ancient Roman censor." The job of a Roman censor was to take the census and to supervise public morals and behavior. Our English word censor––which means to suppress speech or other forms of expression––is from this Latin word.

Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-Va., was censured by the Rappahannock County Republican Committee last week over his voting record, his third reprimand by a local GOP group since officiating a same-sex wedding several weeks ago.

60. mordant
If you like Edgar Allan Poe and "The Addams Family," you have a taste for mordant entertainment — that is, anything particularly grim or dark in nature.

The original meaning of mordant (which comes from the Latin word modere, meaning "to bite or sting,") was that of a physical substance that literally bit into something, such as the one used to set dye into fabrics, or etch lines into a copper plate. Now, mordant generally refers to a dark or biting artistic style, sense of humor, or psychological outlook.
